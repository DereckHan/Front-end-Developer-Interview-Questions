#Front-end Job Interview Questions

This file contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

**Note:** Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

#### JS Questions:

* Explain event delegation

based on event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by target element and then propagated to outer elements(father). So event delegation is a handling that binds a event to the outer element rather than to each of its children elements. It's a easy way for event listener to manage.

eg: click<li>, delete it

* add click to every <li>
* add click listener to <ul>(recommend)

```在`<ul>`节点上添加event listener：
language-javascript
// Get the element, add a click listener...
document.getElementsByTag("ul")[0].addEventListener("click", function(e) {
    // e.target is the clicked element
    // If it was a list item
    if(e.target && e.target.nodeName == "LI") {
        // List item found.  Do whatever you want.
        console.log("List item ", e.target.id.replace("post-"), " was clicked!");
    }
});
```

* Explain how `this` works in JavaScript

function example(){
console.log(this.id);
}
function example2(e){
console.log(e.id);
}
var targetElem = document.getElementById("imp");
var target=document.getElementById("work");
example();//show "undefinde", as example is a global function(直接调用的情况下), so \this\ is the obj of window. 
targetElem.onclick=example;//show "imp", as example is a declared function in obj targetElem, so 通过object调用example，\this\ is targetElem.
targetElem.onclick=function(){
  return example();
}//show "undefined", 因为example还是被直接调用了，\this\ is window
targetElem.onclick=function(){
  return example2(this);// \this\ is targetElem
}//show"imp"
targetElem.conclick=example.bind(target);//show"work", as bind() already change the context from targetElem to target, so \this\ is object target.

* Explain how prototypal inheritance works

javaScript在ES6之前没有显式类继承，所以要实现继承类，需要用prototype property.是继承实例（无法实现继承接口）

child.prototype=Object.create(father.prototype);
child.prototype.constructor=child;//constructor要指定给child, 否则指向的是father
可以override methode
